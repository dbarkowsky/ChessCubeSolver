# Chess Cube Solver

Something that I reworked from the Advent of Code 2022 in order to solve the chess puzzle known as the Knight's Tour, but when the board is actually a cube.

Currently set at 3x3-sized cube faces. Prints out the list of locations it lands on.

There is an assumed cube shape indicated at the top of the file.
